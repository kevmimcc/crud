crud
====

A CRUD class to work with MySQL kinda like ActiveRecord in Ruby


Some examples of usage are included in the bottom.  Simply create a class for each table in your database and include
  table names and primary index names as well as relationships and you can use them almost like ActiveRecord in Ruby.
  There are still advancements that can be made, but the current version helps me a lot and I can do all I need with
  MySQL without needing to write a single query.
